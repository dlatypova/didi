## How was my fourth week?

Last week was not full of bright events again. As always, I did laboratory work on the OS and programmed a little in C++.

In the process of doing laboratory work No. 9 on OS, I gained practical skills in working with the Emacs editor. The emacs editor turned out to be more convenient than the vi editor. In laboratory work No. 10 on OS, I learned the basics of programming in the UNIX/Linux OS shell and learned how to write small batch files. The end of the module is coming soon, so I want to finish the lab work as soon as possible.

Also last week I went with the guys to play volleyball, it was fun. I took a little break from my studies.

I think next week will be the final one, I will try to close all the subjects.
