## How was my second week?

Last week, in honor of the holiday, we had one day off. On this day, my friends and I took a walk around Moscow. The rest of my days were also devoted to Laboratory work on OS, programming technology and a Computer workshop on IT.

According to the OS, we did the 2nd stage of the project and two laboratory works №5 and №6. In Laboratory work №5, I got acquainted with the Linux file system, its structure, names and contents of directories. In addition, I acquired practical skills in using commands to work with files and directories, managing processes (and works), checking disk usage and maintaining the file system. And in Laboratory work №6, I got acquainted with the tools for searching files and filtering text data.

And also acquired practical skills: process management (and tasks), disk usage verification and file system maintenance. In the 2nd stage of the project, it was necessary to fill out information about yourself on the website.

I still practice programming technology in C++, and at the computer workshop on IT - in Arduino. In general, the whole subsequent module will be full of programming for me.
