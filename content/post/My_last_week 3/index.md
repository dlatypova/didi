## How was my third week?

Last week I had more Arduino programming. And in general, the week passed as well as the past.

In laboratory work №7 on the OS, I mastered the basic capabilities of the Midnight Commander command shell, and also acquired practical skills in viewing directories and files; manipulating them. In laboratory work №8, I got acquainted with the Linux operating system and gained practical skills working with the vi editor installed by default in almost all distributions. Laboratory work was not particularly difficult. I did seven laboratory works on Arduino, each of them was interesting.

I think next week will be more intense than the previous ones.
