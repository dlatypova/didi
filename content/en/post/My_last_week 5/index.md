## How was my fourth week?

Last week I closed all the debts. I wrote a test paper on the Russian language, passed laboratory work and homework in C++. I also did laboratory work on the OS and programmed a little in the Arduino language.

In the course of laboratory work No. 11 and No. 12 on the OS, I learned the basics of programming in the UNIX OS shell and learned how to write more complex command files using logical control structures and loops. I also presented a report last week. This week we are finally finishing the laboratory work.

In fact, it is quite difficult to switch from one programming language to another in one week. It's good that the training module ends soon and the next weeks will be credits.
